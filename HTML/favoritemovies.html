    <h1>FIRST FAVORITE MOVIE - GONE WITH THE WIND</h1>

    <!--THE CONTENT OF THE INFO AND BODY OF THE INFO-->
    <p>Presented as originally released in 1939. Includes themes and 
        character depictions which may be offensive and problematic to 
        contemporary audiences. Epic Civil War drama focuses on the life of 
        petulant Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara. Starting with her idyllic 
        life on a sprawling plantation, the film traces her survival through
         the tragic history of the South during the Civil War and Reconstruction, 
         and her tangled love affairs with Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler.</p>

     <!--MY SECOND FAVORITE MOVIE-->
     <h1>SECOND FAVORITE MOVIE - MY FAIR LADY</h1>
     <p>In this beloved musical, pompous phonetics professor Henry Higgins 
         (Rex Harrison) is so sure of his abilities that he takes it upon himself 
         to transform a Cockney working-class girl into someone who can pass for 
         a cultured member of high society. His subject turns out to be the lovely 
         Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), who agrees to speech lessons to improve 
         her job prospects. Higgins and Eliza clash, then form an unlikely bond -- 
         one that is threatened by an aristocratic suitor (Jeremy Brett).</p>
